# QuickPOS (SPM_CODES)

This repository contains a small landing site for QuickPOS (SPM_CODES).

Contents:
- `quickpos-landing/index.php` — main landing page
- `quickpos-landing/thank-you.html` — post-submission page
- `quickpos-landing/css/style.css` — styles

How to run locally:

1. If you have PHP installed, you can serve the site from the project root:

```powershell
php -S localhost:8000 -t quickpos-landing
```

2. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

Notes:
- A `.gitignore` was added to exclude vendor files, OS artifacts, and editor configs.
- This repo was pushed to `https://github.com/zainabk-design/QuickPOS.git`.

If you'd like, I can add a LICENSE, improve the README with deployment steps, or create a basic CI workflow.
